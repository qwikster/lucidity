## what?
`lucidity` is a Python library designed to make minimal yet aesthetic CLI programs.

## how?
a fairly exhaustive feature list-
- theming system
    - load themes from a file, persist between sessions
    - create new themes
    - comes with multiple premade themes
    - reference theme colors easily
- storage system
    - easily save and load config information to disk without using a config library
- box drawing tools
- buffer system
- input listening
- hotkeys
- more to come...

- works on all terminal emulators

## ok but how?
[RTFM](TFM.md)

## ok but like seriously how?
> [!WARNING]
> use `pipx` if your system tells you to! for example, Arch Linux

install the demo: `pip install TODO ADD`
